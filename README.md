INDUCTION PROJECT BY ARYAN 

## Overview

This project is my first flutter project and is intended for my induction submission for my GDSC app development task.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

I chose the music player app from a bunch of projects. I thought of this to be slightly more interesting and intriguing than others.


I have made this on flutter framework owing to its cross platform capabilities. The programming language used is Dart. I have named it "HarmonyHub" as directed.
The app needs an actual device , virtual device emulator is not preferred. This can be done by connecting device through adb using usb or wirelessly over wifi, usb being the prefered mode. The device must have songs included in it , all permissions required by the app for access must be granted for smooth functioning. Click on any song shown , then that song starts playing.
